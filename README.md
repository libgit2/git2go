git2go
======

Go bindings for [libgit2](http://libgit2.github.com/). These bindings are for top-of-the-branch libgit2, and they move fast, things may or may not work. Operator get me Beijing-jing-jing-jing!

Installing
----------

Just `go get github.com/libgit2/git2go`. You'll need to have top-of-the-branch libgit2 from development installed in your system and available via `pkg-config`. These bindings are in sync with the top of `development`.

Development
-----------

## script/bootstrap

It installs `libgit2` for development.

## script/test

It runs tests with the proper environment variables set up.
