# Bundled dynamic library
# =======================
# In order to avoid having to manipulate `git_dynamic.go`, which would prevent
# the system-wide libgit2.so from being used in a sort of ergonomic way, this
# instead moves the complexity of overriding the paths so that the built
# libraries can be found by the build and tests.
